News App
The News App is a simple web application that allows users to fetch and display news articles based on their search queries. It utilizes the News API to retrieve up-to-date news data from various sources. Users can enter keywords in the search bar, click on predefined category buttons, and view news articles with their respective images, titles, sources, and descriptions.
